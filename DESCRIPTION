Description: This R package computes and integrates surface energy balance
    components of evapotranspiration (ET), Sensible heat(H), soil heat flux(G) and
    Net Radiation(Rn) into FAO56 water balance model. The SEBKc package can perform Single Kc, 
    Dual Kc and the integration of thermal-based Evaporative Fractions in a water balance model.
    The SEB models include the Two Source Surface Energy Balance (TSEB) such as TSEB-PT, 
    TSEB-PM and TSEB-Parallel as well as One Source Surface Energy Balance (OSEB) models such as 
    SEBAL, METRIC, SEBI, SSEB and SEBS.
