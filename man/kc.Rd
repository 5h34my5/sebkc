\description{
This function computes FAO56 crop coefficients and water balance. 
The output of the model includes crop evapotranspiration, water stress coefficient,
irrigation requirements, soil available water, etc. In addition to point estimation,
spatial modelling is integrated using Evaporation fractions from 
\code{\link{sebal}}, \code{\link{sebi}}, \code{\link{ETo}},  \code{\link{sseb}},  
\code{\link{sebs}}. \code{cal.kc} can be used to calibrate  the model.
}
\details{
\describe{
 \item{\strong{Using Existing Tables}}{The function include backend database of FAO Tables.
 The user can use the parameter values such as Zr, h, p, FC, WP, etc from FAO56 tables. 
 Most of the parameters with NULL values can take default values from FAO56 Tables. When a crop name results in 3 crops,
  the user can differentiate  that with  regexpr parameter. For example, 
  a crop parameter with a name "maize" can match
  two crops on FAO Table 12. Including  regexpr parameter with "sweet" with match only one. 
  }
 \item{\strong{Modelling crop height and Rooting Depth}}{ 
 At each time step a crop height or root depth is estimated. 
 The crop  or rooting depth growth model can take  exponential model of the form
 hday=0+0.75*max(h)*(1-exp(-day/0.75*max(days))) or    Zrday=0+0.75*Zr*(1-exp(-day/0.75*max(days)))
  The gaussian model is of the form hday=0+0.75*max(h)*(1-exp(-day^2/(0.75*max(days)^2))) or Zrday=0+0.75*(1-exp(-day^2/(0.75*max(day))^2))
  The linear model is of the form hday=(day*max(h))/max(days), Zrday=(day*Zr)/max(days)
    }
 \item{\strong{Point modeling with Single and dual crop coefficients}}{ 
 The function can estimate kc curve for the growing period by using the traditional
 kcini, kcmid and kcend and crop lengths growth stages, in case of single crop coefficients.
 Just like single crop coefficients, the dual crop coefficients kcbini, kcbmid, kcbend are
 embedded in kc parameter. The "kc" parameter must take 3 
 values as c(initial, mid, end). The values of "lengths" parameter must also be specified as
 c(initial, dev, mid, late). See example section for more details.}
  \item{\strong{Spatial modeling With Evaporation Fraction}}{ 
  Instead of supplying kcs values as described above, Evaporation Fraction (EF) from
  can be used. The corresponding EF at initital, mid amd end seasons can be supplied.
  The EF curve will be developed for each location at each time step and ETa derived 
  from (EF*Rn)/2.45.
  }
  \item{\strong{Interpolation of Input data}}{ Once EF is used instead of Kcs, one can
  provide  longitudes and latitudes in xydata parameter data frame. A 2D column data of P,
  I,ETo,RHmin, u2, Rn for each time step for each location can be provided. At each time step 
  an inverse distance interpolation will be perform to get continuous surface. In case of initial
  and static input column data such as CNII, FC, WP, initgw, Zr, h can also be interpolated.
  }
  \item{\strong{Calibration}}{A calibration of unmeasured variables can be done with \code{cal.kc}}
